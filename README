There are no actual opensource scripts right now. You have to pay for it if you want it. Yi12345 project is inactive, so I'm fixing this version and making all changes open for everybody.
If you find a bug fill free to report it. I will try to provide a solution to it as soon as possible.

Note: This is not an exact copy of T4. Some changes have been made to the interface and gameplay in order to provide a better stability and player experience.

Thank you,
